			<h1><b>1. What is Human Computer Interaction(HCI)? </b></h1>
			<p id = "p1">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Computer Interaction is a term use to refer in how human communicate with the machines.
			It is a study of how people interact to them which is the computer and what capablities of computers 
			and possible innovations that can help human of the use of computers in our way of living.

			<h1><b>2. The Difference between the terms "User Interface(UI)" and "Human Computer Interaction(HCI)"</b></h1>
			<p id = "p2">
					<h2>A. User Interface(UI)</h2>
					<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The user interface is a system which helps user communicate with the computer system and/or the application system.</p>
					<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. UI consists of all the hardware, software, screens, menus, functions, and features that affect two-way communications between the user and the computer.</p> 		
					<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. A good user interface provides a unifying structure for finding, viewing, and invoking the different components of a system.</p>
					<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. An interface is a set of commands or menus through which a user communicates with program. A menu-driven interface is one in which you select command choices from various menus displayed on the screen.</p> 
					<h2>B. Human Computer Interaction</h2>
					<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involving the study, planning, and design of the interaction between people(user) and its often regarded as the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences design and several other field of study.</p>

			<h1><b>3. The importance of HCI in every aspect of life. </b></h1>
			<p id = "p3">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Human Computer Interaction or HCI is important in almost all the time of our life
				we are almost always applying it in our dailiy living. By having knowledge of HCI we are able know how we can understand the use of different technolgy 
				specially for the ordinary user of computers which even without the presence of the software or hardaware developer they tend to understan 
				how they can use and what it is purposely made of through User Interface which then communicate with the people for them to interact thus, its is automated program 
				which allows the human to communcate with returning a message throu which we can understand as our natural language.

			<h1><b>4. HCI Revolution: Past,Present and future. </b></h1>
			<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computers are a very good tool with various purposes that human can use since the history of the invention of such machines and its has 4 phases of evolution</p>
			<p style = "font-size:20px;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Screen and keyboard</b></p>
			<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				The very first generation of this kind of machines, which is familiar by most people. Through monitors, people
				can read the outputs from the computers. the input is captured by keyboards, which is the only ways. And the "computers"
				act in the middle to carry out the calculation or simply do the tasks given. Maybe due to the "Ugly" appearance, people are hardly
				treat it as a nice "Friend" rather than a machine. 
			<p style = "font-size:20px;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Mouse, GUI Computers</b></p>
			<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					With the mouse and computer GUI which is the Graphical use interface, Human appreciate the loveliness of 
					this invention that accept it as a human friend and many peopl love the way interacts with the for being useful in many ways. 
			</p>
			<p style = "font-size:20px;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Touch Screen, Portable Devices</b></p>
			<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Steve jobs once said, we humans were born with the finest tools to interact with our computers that was our 
					hands, our fingers. This kind of inovation worls a lot better and become a trend in using devices which enables
					one to use it with the use our fingers directly with it. Devices mainly the mobile phones is the best example of this. 
			</p>


			</p>

			<p style = "font-size:20px;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Voie Control-General Computers</b></p>
			<p style = "font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					In this phase of evolution of computers, computers is alsmost considered as human for it can have its own system 
					which allows them to analyse and response accordingly. however thier programs are really complicated in nature. 
					As we all know artificial intelligence already exist together with the human in society and it fives a lot of benefits in our 
					world today more adnvance result of research are getting easier with the help of technology and definitely more invemtion 
					would be made in the near future and continiously inovating and upgrading. Voice recognition is the most popular when it comes 
					to giving a command to a computer particulary the in a certain robot as if you are literally talking to them as a human and it is the product of 
					HCI.
